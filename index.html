							<p>This is a multi-robot indoor delivery system. It will understand the command from human voice using Alexa framework, 
								then make food delivery to people inside a specific building. This robotic system exists to solve the problem of the need to traverse through
								complicated office setting. Originally we were exploring the problem of last mile food delivery in office then we generalized this problem to all deliveries within office / indoor settings.</p>

						<h2>What was Created</h2>
					</header>

					<div class="features">

						<div class="container">
							<h3><b>Technical descriptions, illustrations</b></h3>
							<p>When the multi robot indoor delivery system is fully functioning, the following components are used. First, Alexa will accept voice command as input. Then, Alexa will call Flask backend to create TASK entries
								and place the newly created tasks into SQLite database. The Flask framework that is originally running on local host can be re-routed using Ngrok so that Alexa can reach it through API calls. On the robot side,
								navigation package and Gazebo simulation must both run. These two can be laucnhed using two launch files included. The controller script of the robot will routinely check for entries within TASK table and 
								dump all of the tasks to whichever robot that is idling at that moment. The robot utilized the pre-built map loaded upon launching the navigation components to naviage through the indoor settings. After arrving 
								at the desired destination, it will check for the presense of the delivery target by looking for a green box indicator using masked image OpenCV. 
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="container">
							<h3><b>Discussion of interesting algorithms, modules, techniques</b></h3>
							<p>Upon dropping off the delivery item after arriving at the desired coordinate, the robot would check if the target is present within the office. This is done by checking whether there is a green box present
								within camera vision of the robot. Although it seems like a very straightforward process, the implementation of this green box detection is not as simple as we expected it to be. First, the robot will head to the 
								coordinate specified within SQLite database with no regards to its orientation upon arrival. This will bring in the possibility where the robot is facing north but the box is right behind the robot in the south 
								direction. Our workaround for this situation is to make the robot rotate itself while actively monitoring the masked image for green color. If found during the rotational process, the robot will halt in motion immediately
								to allow the dropoff of the delivery item. The second challenge we faced during this process is the color detection. The green color would not be actively filtered out by our masks sometimes due to the shadow and 
								lighting condition. This issue can be resolved by altering the visual properties of the box to make it either self illuminate or make ambient (color of the object when no lights pointing at it) and diffuse (color of the object under 
								pure white light) lighting property the exact same.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="container">
							<h3><b>Problems that were solved, pivots that had to be taken</b></h3>
							<p>
								The frontend part is implemented using Alexa, it will  be trigger by "Hi Bot". Then the system will try to listen voice, try to understand it and make corresponding behaviour based on it.
								Since this is a delivery bot system. it expect to receive recipient information. Once enough information got collected, then the code delpoyed on lambda will talk with backend to check whether 
								recipient name is legal since if no nobody work inside the building with specified name. robot will have no idea where to deliver.
							</p>
							<p>
								After the task is created. The node responsible for organizing robot will detect that and it will send command to robot to start deliver every 5 minutes and mark that robot into "busy" status.
							</p>
							<p>As for building map of the building, we planned out simulation of a simple office setting using the pre-built willow garage as the basic blueprint. It turned out the garage map itself is too big to be completly included. 
								To simplify the environmenmt a little bit with no sacrifice to the core functionality of our system, we only mapped part of the willow garage setting while leaving the rest out. This minor change allows 
								us to demonstrate the full functionality of our delivery system and to spend minimal time on waiting for certain basic task to finish. For instance, we no longer need to wait for the robot to slowly make
								itself all the way to one side of the office and we may focusing on demonstrating how the robot handling the case where the delovery target is not present in the office. <br>
							</p>
							<p> </p>
							<p>Another change worthing mentioning is more significant as it is related to the core architecture of the delivery system. Our original vision is that when the robot is placed into a new environment, it will have
								functionality to explore its sorroundings and register cetain landmarks to the database. If it runs into a person's office cube, as an example, it could register the coordiate of the office that person is located
								in without the need of manually set up. However, we identified this approach, although very plausible to implement, should be excluded or at least altered. Rarely, we would find the robot a new environment that needs
								self exploration as self exploration would be very slow and often unreliable (could miss several office cubes). The robot would identify an unique colored object within each office cube to identify the person and then store 
								both the color and the coorinate to the database. There would be a mapping between color and each individual. If robot got a command from Alexa to deliver to "Stephen", it would look up the color of Stephen and the coordniate
								of the box related to that color. <br><br>
								After the pivot, the robot now still could scan the color when arriving within the office cube. It is looking for a green box or a red box instead of colored boxes as identifiers. The green box would mark the persoon
								is present in the office and the bot can safely unload the delivery task while the red box would symbolize the person is not there and the bot would come back at a later time to make a second delivery attempt.

							<h3>How it unfolded, how the team worked together</h3>
							<p>
								Try to balance the work load and assign task based on interests and skills.
								Yifei works more on backend part and Daniel works more on frontend part
							</p>
							<p>
								update task weekly and meet to discuss progress every week to makre sure there is no blocker and teammates are on the same page

							<h3>Reflection on the project and working as a team</h3>
							<p>
								Working very efficiently as team and we can try to add more functionality to the robots such as actively taking to human rather than just answer questions.
								
							</p>
							<p>
								We can also try to redesign the robot to make it looks fancier
